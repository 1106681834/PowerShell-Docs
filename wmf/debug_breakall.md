# Break into Debugger from Running Scripts

The Windows PowerShell console and Windows PowerShell ISE now allow you to break into the debugger for running scripts. This works in both local and remote sessions.

In the console, press **Ctrl+Break**.

In ISE, press **Ctrl+B**, or use the **Debug-&gt;Break All** menu command.
