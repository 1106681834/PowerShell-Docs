This topic lists the [!INCLUDE[wps_1](../Token/wps_1_md.md)] modules included with Microsoft System Center. The [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)] modules in the list support automating the features of System Center and provide links to the cmdlet references for each module. These modules enable you to use [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)] to administer, maintain, configure, and develop new features for System Center.
