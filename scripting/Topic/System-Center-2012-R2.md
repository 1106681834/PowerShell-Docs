# System Center 2012 R2

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page needs to be emptied (made into a stub topic) and this content moved to the System Center db as a parent topic for all the modules. This stub topic will then be connected to that topic.

This topic lists the [!INCLUDE[wps_1](../Token/wps_1_md.md)] modules included with Microsoft System Center. The [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)] modules in the list support automating the features of System Center and provide links to the cmdlet references for each module. These modules enable you to use [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)] to administer, maintain, configure, and develop new features for System Center.

The table below also shows the latest published version of the Help for each module. The Help is available in the TechNet Library by using the links below, or as Updatable Help files.  Updatable Help was introduced with Windows PowerShell 3.0 and enables you to have the latest Help topics available locally on your computer. See [about_Updatable_Help](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/10bba75c-f4ac-4ca1-bbf3-8f34dd521ffe) for more information.
