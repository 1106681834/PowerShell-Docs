# The Windows PowerShell ISE Scripting Object Model
  The [!INCLUDE[ise_1](../Token/ise_1_md.md)] exposes its functionality through an underlying scripting object model that enables users to write [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../Token/wps_2_md.md)] scripts that manipulate the various visual and functional aspects of the [!INCLUDE[ise_2](../Token/ise_2_md.md)]. Scripting objects, their properties, and their methods are defined specifically for this purpose.
